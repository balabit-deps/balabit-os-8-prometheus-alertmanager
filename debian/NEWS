prometheus-alertmanager (0.15.0~rc.2-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  The Debian package of the alertmanager does not include a web application.

  Please, use the amtool command-line application to obtain equivalent
  functionality.

  Alternatively, you can deploy your own files to be served by the embedded web
  server, by placing them in /usr/share/prometheus/alertmanager/ui/, or by
  using the --web.local-assets option to point to a different path. Note that
  the web server will only serve files in the lib and app sub-directories.

  You can still use the HTTP API, and the special handlers:

    /metrics
    /-/reload
    /-/healthy
    /-/ready
